    • In the first argument of ‘T’, namely ‘Int’
      In the type signature: g :: T Int

tcfail160.hs:8:1: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘T Int’ with actual type ‘p0 -> p0’
    • The equation(s) for ‘g’ have one argument,
      but its type ‘T Int’ has none
    • Relevant bindings include g :: T Int (bound at tcfail160.hs:8:1)
